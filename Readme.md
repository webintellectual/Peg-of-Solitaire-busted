<img align="right" src="Images/solitaire.jpg" width=200>
Game of marble solitaire is also known as peg of solitaire. In this game we have board with 33 holes. Initially all holes are filled with marbles except the center hole.
Moves: We can pick only a marble that is 2 unit distance away from an empty hole (horizontally or vertically) and there must be a marble hole b/w this marble and the empty hole. We put this marble in the hole and remove marble (from the board) b/w the marble picked for action and the empty hole.

Objective: Finding list of moves to reach goal state of board (only one peg presenr and at center) in reasonable time.
